# Introduction

Welcome to the Ameliorate documentation!

## Mission & Vision

Ameliorate's mission is to empower humanity to effectively solve problems by making it trivial to understand the intricacies and perspectives involved.

Imagine a world where:

- you never have to leave a conversation frustrated that you aren't understood, or that you can't understand someone else;
- politicians and citizens of diverse perspectives can work together and be satisfied with decisions intended to better society;
- _anyone_ has the power to gain traction on an overwhelming problem.

## Where should I go next?

The documentation is split into an App section, which describes the tool itself (e.g. how to use, features, comparisons to other tools, etc.), and a Project section, which houses anything auxiliary to the app (e.g. discourse sessions, release status, etc.).
