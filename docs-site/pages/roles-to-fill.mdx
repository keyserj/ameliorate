# Roles to Fill

Hi there! I'm Joel, the core maintainer of Ameliorate.

Currently, I'm "wearing many hats", trying to play a bunch of needed roles in order to make Ameliorate the best it can be. But I'm not great at all of these, and I'm definitely not great at doing them all at the same time. I think if others could help with these roles, Ameliorate would really thrive.

These could be filled by part-time volunteer efforts, but ideally funding would enable full-time roles. If you're interested in any of these roles, please [reach out](https://github.com/amelioro/ameliorate/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#reaching-out) and you'll be considered if Ameliorate gets enough funding to hire.

Note: these are only what have come to mind as most-needed; there are many other ways to contribute that would still be helpful.

## "Co-founder"

- if there's only funding for one other role, it would have to be someone else that:
  - is very passionate about the mission, vision, and how the tool is intended to accomplish those
  - can help split all the desired roles below with me
  - preferably has marketing/socializing/community-building skills

## UX designer

- make interface intuitive, sleek, and enjoyable
  - these are critical for expanding usage/popularity/productiveness
- help landing page effectively convey the tool's value & vision, be inspiring

## Marketer/socializer/community-builder

- find people interested in the tool
- help convey value of the tool, inspire interest
- take people from "interested" to "using"/"getting value from" the tool
- foster a community around the tool, both for users and contributors
- probably host discourse sessions
- maybe make youtube videos, blog posts?
- potentially look for donors...? maybe separate role for that though? and probably should focus on community first

## Active user

- someone who actually just wants to use the tool all the time
- find opportunities to use the tool
- help refine the tool - not just its features, but its core concepts too
- perhaps there should be one of these roles to use the tool for community-style Topics, and one for small-group-style Topics

## Developer

- code quality from one person (i.e. myself) suffers tremendously without someone else to critique/review it
- there are way too many [features](https://github.com/orgs/amelioro/projects/2/views/1) to implement myself
- ideally I'd probably step back a little from development so I can aid the other roles/perform higher-level tasks

## Part time HR...?

- help hire people
- handle salaries/benefits
- manage nonprofit status?
